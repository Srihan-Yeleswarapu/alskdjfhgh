// SpeedLimitDataSource.swift
// Typed enum that replaces the stringly-typed source labels previously hard-coded
// into SmartSpeedLimitService. The legacy DB cases remain Codable-compatible but
// are retired and are never produced by the active provider pipeline.
//
// Why typed (not String)?
//   - Catches typos at compile time (you can't write `.lvieArcGIS` by mistake).
//   - The UI can either display `.rawValue` directly, or map each case to a
//     localized strings file later. Today the UI just reads `rawValue`.
//   - Existing string keys ("DB", "DB (Recovered)", "No Data") are preserved
//     so the DeveloperTabView / DebugLogger strings don't change.
