// SpeedLimitService.swift
// Orchestrator that picks the best speed-limit answer for the user's current coord.
//
// Decision tree (cache-first / rate-limit-first; HERE-only):
//   1. Consult the short-lived HERE response cache (local memory, 30 min TTL,
//      spatial grid keyed by the user's location). If we already know this
//      location, we send NO network request at all.
//   2. Consult the validated HERE batch cache (SQLite, populated by the
//      initial 2.5km setup grid + just-in-time geofence triggers).
//   3. Only when BOTH local caches miss (or the user tapped manual refresh)
//      do we query HERE REST live — and the provider's own 100 m success
//      distance throttle further caps how often genuinely-new locations
//      actually hit the API.
//   4. If all HERE paths miss, return No Data and let the continuity guard
//      apply its normal miss-grace window.
//
// Trade-off note: cache-first means a recently-installed sign change is only
// picked up after the response cache TTL expires (30 min) or the batch cache
// is refreshed — the deliberate cost of protecting the HERE freemium rate
// limit (250k requests/month) from a 1-Hz GPS loop. Manual refresh still
// bypasses every cache so the driver can force a live answer anytime.
//
// @Published dataSource retains legacy localDB cases for decoding compatibility,
// but this service never creates or publishes them.
//
// PHASE 4 -- SpeedLimit Continuity Guard
// --------------------------------------
// When the user drives under a flyover, reverse geocoding can briefly resolve
// `roadName` to a nearby road for ~3-5 seconds while the underlying arterial's
// name re-resolves. The
// continuity guard holds a suspect live-provider answer during that window
// instead of allowing a nearby road result to flicker onto the HUD.
//
// The guard dampens that flicker WITHOUT blocking legitimate road transitions:
//   * Small speed delta (<= SUSPICIOUS_JUMP_MPH=15 mph) AND no
//     geocoder-provider disagreement  -> commit immediately
//     (normal driver behavior on the same road).
//   * Geocoder-provider road-name disagreement (geocoder says "same road"
//     but provider says "different road key") -> SUSPECT regardless of delta.
//     The geocoder is an independent ground-truth signal for "which road am I on?"
//     and any disagreement likely means a cross-street GPS snap.
//   * Speed delta > SUSPICIOUS_JUMP_MPH AND conflicting road identity -> SUSPECT.
//     Hold the prior committed limit for up to 3 fetches. A second fetch that
//     reproduces the suspect identity commits it (real transition). A second fetch
//     that disagrees commits that result, dropping the suspect.
//   * Physics override: if `|new - currentSpeed| <= 10 mph` AND the prior limit
//     was already off-physics, commit immediately even with a big delta. This
//     case models a real highway on-ramp -- the driver is accelerating at 72 mph,
//     so the 75 mph answer is the only one matching physics regardless of (false)
//     geocode.
//   * Sink-in: 3 consecutive suspect fetches with the same identity commit anyway
//     (long-term geocode stuck -- user has clearly changed roads).
//
// IMPORTANT: the guard fires BEFORE cache writes, so the 75 mph flyover flicker
// does NOT poison the speedLimitResponseCache for the next fetch in the same
// 50 m cell.
//
// Concurrency note: `@MainActor` serializes state transitions between awaits,
// while `latestUpdateGeneration` below makes the newest overlapping GPS/manual
// request authoritative before continuity state or HUD values are committed.
