// NetworkReachability.swift
// Lightweight wrapper around NWPathMonitor that publishes whether the device has an
// active network path. SmartSpeedLimitService uses this to decide whether to
// attempt the active HERE provider. When offline, it returns No Data rather
// than silently using OSM/ArcGIS or the retired Arizona-only dataset.
//
// Why @MainActor? The published `isConnected` is consumed by the @MainActor
// orchestrator (SmartSpeedLimitService) on every speed-limit fetch. Keeping both
// on the same isolation domain avoids Task hops on the hot path.
