// NavigationCoordinator.swift
//
// Extracted from DriveViewModel so the navigation loop is independently
// unit-testable. Owns turn-by-turn progression, off-route detection, voice
// announcements, ETA computation, and the periodic reroute timer.
//
// DriveViewModel exposes a single @Published `navigationCoordinator` field
// here; session-recording state stays on DriveViewModel and is accessed via
// injected closures. To unit test: pass closures from your fixture — no need
// to construct a full DriveViewModel. The no-arg `init()` wires to no-op
// closures suitable for isolated coord tests; the parameterized `init` is
// what DriveViewModel uses to wire to production behavior.
//
// Design notes (per the extractor's design pass):
//   • Properties moved verbatim — @Published `nextManeuverInstruction`,
//     `nextManeuverImageName`, `distanceToNextTurn`, `eta`,
//     `distanceToDestination`, `nextManeuverCoordinate`, `currentRoute`,
//     `destination`, `destinationItem`, `isRerouting`,
//     `offRouteThreshold`, `lastRerouteTime`, `isCalculatingReroute`.
//   • Methods moved verbatim by name — `selectDestinationAndCalculateRoutes`,
//     `startNavigation(with:isReroute:)`, `startNavigation(to:)`,
//     `endNavigation`, `updateNavigationProgress(at:)`,
//     `checkOffRouteStatus(at:)`, `advanceToNextStep`, etc. Caller code is
//     updated to read `viewModel.navigationCoordinator.<X>` for nav state.
//   • Voice/TTS is private to this class — `AVSpeechSynthesizer`,
//     session ownership (via AudioSessionCoordinator), `announce`,
//     `expandAbbreviations`, the delegate hooks. We don't expose a
//     VoiceAnnouncer protocol yet (kept simple per the user's "don't
//     over-engineer the extraction" guideline). Tests can drive the
//     rest of the pipeline by populating closures for state reads and
//     capturing side effects through injected closures alone.
//   • VM-owned state reads (`isRecording`, `nearbyCameras`, `availableRoutes`)
//     are injected as closures (NO DriveViewModel reference inside the
//     coordinator) so the coordinator remains unit-testable without the VM.
//   • VM-owned state writes (`availableRoutes` from MKDirections) flow back
//     through `availableRoutesSetter` so the coord never touches the VM
//     directly.
//   • Cross-cutting side effects (startSession, LiveActivity) are also
//     injected so a test coord can verify "startNavigation called
//     startSession exactly once when isRecording was false" without
//     spinning up a real session recorder.
