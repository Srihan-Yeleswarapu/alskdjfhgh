Archived Python parity helpers
------------------------------
The `name_match_score`, `snap`, and related geometry helpers below are retained
only for the historical regression tests (`test_snap_named.py` and
`test_snap_corridor.py`) and future all-states replacement work. They are not
called by the HTTP orchestrator, do not open a database, and are not an active
speed-limit provider. The production pipeline is HERE Batch → HERE REST →
ArcGIS → Overpass → No Data.

If the archived AZ implementation is ever reactivated, update these helpers
and their tests alongside the Swift implementation; do not add them back to
`orchestrate_speed_limit` without replacing the dataset with nationwide data.

Stdlib only. Run:
    python website/server.py

# decision so the website's tests can regression-check the same algorithm
# without spawning Swift tests.
#
# Background: when the user drives under a flyover, CLGeocoder can briefly
# resolve `roadName` to the OVERPASS road for ~3-5 seconds. The orchestrator
# then publishes the freeway's 75 mph for that window, before SQLite
# name-match corrects back to 45 mph. This guard dampens that flicker.
#
# Rules (mirrored byte-for-byte from SmartSpeedLimitService.swift):
#   1. Small speed delta (<= 20 mph) OR same-road identity  -> commit immediately
#   2. Physics override: |new - userSpeed| <= 10 AND |prior - userSpeed| > 15
#      (driver is moving at the new speed; the answer matching physics wins)
#   3. Suspect hold: hold prior for up to 5 consequent fetches with the
#      same (roadName, roadKey) identity. After 5, sink-in.
#

# run this guard -- it just ships the raw answer. The Python mirror exists
